    "Trying to track ROI target by adjusting cpc - assume that RPC doesnt change w/ cpc\n",
    "```\n",
    "ROI_obs = RPC_obs / CPC_obs\n",
    "ROI_target = RPC_obs / CPC_target\n",
    "ROI_obs * CPC_obs = ROI_target * CPC_target\n",
    "CPC_target = ROI_obs/ROI_target * CPC_obs = RPC_obs / ROI_target\n",
    "```\n",
    "Currently we calculate `RPC_obs` against real data - but monietization data may be spares - or u may have to go so far in the past that it no longer apllies to present\n",
    "\n",
    "Can use lead score as way to leverage more plentiful session data - w/o relying on monetization events\n",
    "\n",
    "Can split `RPC_obs` into 2 factors and a bias term: `RPQ_obs`, `QPS_obs`, and `R0` (revenue at 0 quality).  Quality is an abstract unit - the idea is that is is derived from lead score and roughly linear w/ revenue on a session level basis.  Ideally - we want to be able to calculate quality w/in sql and aggregate it at query time so we dont have to work w/ session level data.  `QPS_obs` can be aggregated w/in a modifier bucket - using plentiful session data.  `RPQ_obs` can be aggregated accross the dataset - under the assumption that `RPQ_obs` will be stable accross an entire channel/platform/product - and possibly b/w platforms/products\n",
    "```\n",
    "RPC_obs = (RPQ_obs * QPS_obs + R0)\n",
    "CPC_target = RPC_obs / ROI_target = (RPQ_obs * QPS_obs + R0) / ROI_target\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain\n",
    "Biddable Dimensions:\n",
    "1. Location (DMA)\n",
    "2. Operating System\n",
    "3. Device Type\n",
    "4. Publisher (website ad was served on)\n",
    "5. Time of Day\n",
    "\n",
    "Split will most likely be on `(DMA,OS,Device)`.  Unsure if there will be enough session level data to support splitting on dimensions beyond that.  We might have to consider some split variables in isolation.  Alternately - we could try using a k-means or percentile-based clustering method to group our data w/in a very fine grained split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "Bascially we want this `rps` estimation to capture long term trends w/o short term  noise.  Ideas:\n",
    "1. plot out rolling 1,7,14,30,60,90 day estimates of rps using regular aggregations and using the lead score stabilized rps estimate\n",
    "    - want time plots and histograms\n",
    "1. compare the rps esimation to rolling rps w/ large window\n",
    "    - at that pt - why not use that rolling rps to estimate?\n",
    "1. if the idea is that we are compensating for data deficiency - why dont we use large buckets to measure bias - and small buckets to measure variance - than combine into some metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial approach\n",
    "Will just naively use `lead_score` as a standin for quality - I think that ultimately precision at that lead score would be the best quality metric - since it basically corresponds to observed conversion rate.  But I think that is best accomplished on @sperks side.  Lets see how this goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given split - I will pull in revenue averages, bucket size, and lead score averages for each bucket.  Will compute `RPQ_obs` and `R0` by fitting a 1 var regressor w/ `y=rps_avg` and `X=[lead_score_avg]` - will use `bucket size` as sample weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: i guess there are actually 2 differnt model scores per lead - I will pivot those out and the linear regressor will have 2 weights - 1 for each model score"
